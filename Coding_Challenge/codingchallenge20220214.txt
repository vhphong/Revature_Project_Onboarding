1) JavaScript:
Write a function that retrieves the top 3 longest words of a newspaper headline and transforms them into hashtags. If multiple words tie for the same length, retrieve the word that occurs first.

Examples
getHashTags("How the Avocado Became the Fruit of the Global Trade")
--> ["#avocado", "#became", "#global"]

getHashTags("Why You Will Probably Pay More for Your Christmas Tree This Year")
--> ["#christmas", "#probably", "#will"]

getHashTags("Hey Parents, Surprise, Fruit Juice Is Not Fruit")
--> ["#surprise", "#parents", "#fruit"]

getHashTags("Visualizing Science")
--> ["#visualizing", "#science"]

2) C#

Create a class Smoothie and do the following:

Create a property called Ingredients.
Create a GetCost method which calculates the total cost of the ingredients used to make the smoothie.
Create a GetPrice method which returns the number from GetCost plus the number from GetCost multiplied by 1.5. Round to two decimal places.
Create a GetName method which gets the ingredients and puts them in alphabetical order into a nice descriptive sentence. If there are multiple ingredients, add the word "Fusion" to the end but otherwise, add "Smoothie". Remember to change "-berries" to "-berry". See the examples below.
Ingredient Price
Strawberries $1.50
Banana $0.50
Mango $2.50
Blueberries $1.00
Raspberries $1.00
Apple $1.75
Pineapple $3.50

Examples
s1 = Smoothie(new string[] { "Banana" })

s1.Ingredients --> { "Banana" }

s1.GetCost() --> "$0.50"

s1.GetPrice() --> "$1.25"

s1.GetName() --> "Banana Smoothie"
s2 = Smoothie(new string[] { "Raspberries", "Strawberries", "Blueberries" })
s2.ingredients --> { "Raspberries", "Strawberries", "Blueberries" }

s2.GetCost() --> "$3.50"

s2.GetPrice() --> "$8.75"

s2.GetName() --> "Blueberry Raspberry Strawberry Fusion"

3) Java:

Create a function that takes the memory size (ms is a string type) as an argument and returns the actual memory size.

Examples
actualMemorySize("32GB") --> "29.76GB"

actualMemorySize("2GB") --> "1.86GB"

actualMemorySize("512MB") --> "476MB"

Notes
-The actual storage loss on a USB device is 7% of the overall memory size!
-If the actual memory size was greater than 1 GB, round your result to two decimal places.
-If the memory size after adjustment is smaller then 1 GB, return the result in MB.

4) Python:

The Atbash cipher is an encryption method in which each letter of a word is replaced with its "mirror" letter in the alphabet: A <=> Z; B <=> Y; C <=> X; etc.

Create a function that takes a string and applies the Atbash cipher to it.

Examples
atbash("apple") --> "zkkov"

atbash("Hello world!") --> "Svool dliow!"

atbash("Christmas is the 25th of December") --> "Xsirhgnzh rh gsv 25gs lu Wvxvnyvi"
