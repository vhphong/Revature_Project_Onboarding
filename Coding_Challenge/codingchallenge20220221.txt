Weekly Coding Challenge:
Pls provide the link to your solution in the comments section not later than Friday morning.

Java,C# & Python:
Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:
192 × 1 = 192
192 × 2 = 384
192 × 3 = 576
By concatenating each product, we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)
The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and(1,2,3,4,5).
What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?

JavaScript:

When coloring a striped pattern, you may start by coloring each square sequentially, meaning you spend time needing to switch coloring pencils.
Create a function where given an array of colors cols, return how long it takes to color the whole pattern. Note the following times:
It takes 1 second to switch between pencils.
It takes 2 seconds to color a square.
See the example below for clarification.
<code>color_pattern_times(["Red", "Blue", "Red", "Blue", "Red"]) ➞ 14</code><code>// There are 5 colors so it takes 2 seconds to color each one (2 x 5 = 10).</code><code>// You need to switch the pencils 4 times and it takes 1 second to switch (1 x 4 = 4).</code><code>// 10 + 4 = 14</code>
Examples
<code>colorPatternTimes(["Blue"]) ➞ 2</code><code>colorPatternTimes(["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue"]) ➞ 11</code><code>colorPatternTimes(["Blue", "Blue", "Blue", "Red", "Red", "Red"]) ➞ 13</code>
Notes
Only change coloring pencils if the next color is different to the color before it.
Return a number in seconds.
